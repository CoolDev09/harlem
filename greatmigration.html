<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    From 1910 to 1970, approximately 6 million African Americans left the rural southern United States and migrated to the urban centers of the Northeast, Midwest, and West. This massive relocation of people was known as the Great Migration. African Americans were motivated to make this journey by the promise of higher-paying jobs and greater personal freedoms, as compared to the poverty, discrimination, and limited opportunities they faced in the South. The influx of African Americans dramatically transformed the demographics and cultures of many American cities, as this significant population shift reshaped the social and economic landscapes across the country.</p>
<h2>Primary Source</h2>
<p>When I suggested that the solution to the problem of the Negro on inadequate wages in the hills might be found in his moving to a plantation in the delta, the comment of this leader was: "The Negro may make more money in the delta, but there he has no incentives."
