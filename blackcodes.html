<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The time after slavery was a time of great struggle and hardship. It was originally supposed to be a time of freedom. Slavery was just abolished by Abraham Lincoln. But, there the ideas of slavery would not die, keeping its ugly hand on the freedom of African Americans. The black codes emerged, creating a status similar to slavery, an idea which would never really die.</p>

<h2>Primary Source</h2>
<p>All contracts between any persons whatever, whereof one or more of them shall be a person of color, for the sale or purchase of any horse, mule, ass, jennet, neat cattle, hog, sheep or goat, whatever may be the value of such articles, and all contracts between such persons for any other article or articles of property whatever of the value of ten dollars or more; and all contracts executed or executory between such persons for the payment of money of the value of ten dollars or more, shall be void as to all persons whatever, unless the same be put in writing and signed by the vendors or debtors, and witnessed by a white person who can read and write</p>
<h2>Primary Source Analysis</h2>
    <p>This specific example of black codes was enforced to prevent African Americans from growing economically, always being a social class below the whites, giving them power. They were unable to sell any goods for over 10 dollars, unless their sales were facilitated by a white person, who in most cases, would never allow the trade to go through, as they want to keep rising in wealth, as the African Americans struggled in poverty.</p>
