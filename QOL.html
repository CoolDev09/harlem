<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Many freedmen believed that life would improve after their release from slavery, but they would come to face a cold reality. The rights they were given were lacking, giving them the bare minimum as citizens. Despite the fact that they were given little rights, many in the South detested the idea that people of color should have rights.</p>
<h2>Primary Source</h2>
<p>“Even after the Emancipation Proclamation, two more years of war, service by African American troops, and the defeat of the Confederacy, the nation was still unprepared to deal with the question of full citizenship for its newly freed black population. The Reconstruction implemented by Congress, which lasted from 1866 to 1877, was aimed at reorganizing the Southern states after the Civil War, providing the means for readmitting them into the Union, and defining the means by which whites and blacks could live together in a non slave society. The South, however, saw Reconstruction as a humiliating, even vengeful imposition and did not welcome it.”
