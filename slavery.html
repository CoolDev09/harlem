<h2>Summary</h2>
<br>
<p>Slavery was a time of great anguish for the African Americans. They were forced into hard, strenuous labor against their will, only for the benefit of the white people, forcing them to work on the plantations. 
In addition to that, the way they would be carried was dreadful. They had poor air conditions, claustrophobic conditions, and physical injury forced upon them. The conditions would be so severe, that many would commit suicide.</p>

<p>“Yes'm. Allotted? Yes'm. I'm goin' to explain that, ' ' she replied. "You see there was slave traders in those days, jes' like you got horse and mule an' auto traders now. They bought and sold slaves and hired 'em out. Yes'm, rented 'em out. Allotted means somethin' like hired out. But the slave never got no wages. That all went to the master. The man they was allotted to paid the master."

    ‘I was never sold. My mama was sold only once, but she was hired out many times. Yes'm when a slave was allotted, somebody made a down payment and gave a mortgage for the rest. A chattel mortgage. . . .’

    ‘Allotments made a lot of grief for the slaves,’ Aunt Sally asserted.‘We left my papa in Kentucky, 'cause he was allotted to another man. My papa never knew where my mama went, an' my mama never knew where papa went." Aunt Sally paused a moment, then went on bitterly. "They never wanted mama to know, 'cause they knowed she would never marry so long she knew where he was. Our master wanted her to marry again and raise more children to be slaves. They never wanted mama to know where papa was, an' she never did,’ sighed Aunt Sally.”
