<h2>Summary<h2>
<h4>Seperate but equal was the idea that justified segregation during the Jim Crow era. Despite claiming to provide equal treatment for black and white citizens, in reality, treatment for black people was almost always lacking. Some examples of Jim Crow Laws include interracial marridge being banned, facilitys for black and white people being seperate and most of the time not equal in favor of white people, as well as unequal employment opertunities.</h4>
<h2>Primary Source</h2>
<p>“Separate but equal” refers to the infamously racist decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) that allowed the use of segregation laws by states and local governments.</p>

<h2>Ideology</h2>
<p>During the time of Jim Crow, many in the South had very racist ideas similar to that of Neo-Nazis, one 
    such example is below is from a farmer from South Carolina.
    <br>
    "The law wasn't made for mules
    <br>
    and niggers! If they work good and
    <br>
    hard and stay in their places they
    <br>
    don't need law." 
    </p>
    <br>
<h2>Vigilante Groups</h2>
<p>This ideology would spawn vigilante groups, who would facilitate these ideas under the guise of acting as a form of justice outside of police, serving what they believed to be justice. However, they would not target those who broke the law officially, they would target who broke their law, which was the ideology mentioned earlier. Their attacks would be arson, lynchings, and  mass murder. Despite the fact that they were outlawed, the terrorists grew. If they were properly charged of their crimes, the lost would be numerous, some crimes would include; 
    <br>
    -Arson
    <br>
    -All degrees of Murder
    <br>
    -Kidnapping
    <br>
    -Terrorism
    <br>
    -Torture
    <br>
    -Imprisonment
    <br>
    -Sexual Violence
    <br>
    -Extermination
